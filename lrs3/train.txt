../lrs3/train_mini/00j9bKdiOjk/50001 ONE DAY A YOUNG BOY COMES UPON THE SUNFLOWER WHILE VISITING THE GARDEN AND HE NOTICES HOW WEAK IT LOOKS
../lrs3/train_mini/00j9bKdiOjk/50002 JUST LIKE REACHING OUT TO THE SUNFLOWER BY PROVIDING SOMEONE WHO IS NEGLECTED ISOLATED OR FORGOTTEN
../lrs3/train_mini/00j9bKdiOjk/50003 THEY ARE INCREDIBLE YET SO OFTEN THEY ARE FORGOTTEN LACKING THE LOVE AND APPRECIATION THEY DESERVE
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50001 AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET YOUR BRAIN INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THESE NEW NETWORKS ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50002 SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50003 SO THEY STARTED TO THINK COULD WE BUILD A NEONATAL INCUBATOR THAT'S BUILT ENTIRELY OUT OF
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50004 IT WILL BE USEFUL IN 2020
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50005 SO WHEN THEY WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE MICROSCOPE WHEN THEY WERE TALKING TO THEIR COLLEAGUE AT THE WATER COOLER AND ALL THESE THINGS
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50007 I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50008 AND THESE TWO GUYS ARE NAMED GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50009 AND THEY START TALKING AND ONE OF THEM SAYS HEY HAS ANYBODY TRIED TO LISTEN FOR THIS THING
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50010 AND SO GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH GO BACK TO WEIFFENBACH'S OFFICE AND THEY START KIND OF NOODLING AROUND HACKING AS WE MIGHT CALL IT NOW
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50011 IT WAS RIGHT AT 20 MHZ SO YOU COULD PICK IT UP REALLY EASILY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS A HOAX BASICALLY
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50012 WE SHOULD RECORD IT
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50013 THAT'S PRETTY COOL
../lrs3/train_mini/0af00UcTOSc/50014 I MEAN HERE YOU HAVE THESE GUYS WHO BASICALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST FOLLOWING THIS HUNCH THIS LITTLE PASSION THAT HAD DEVELOPED
../lrs3/train_mini/0akiEFwtkyA/50001 IN LIGHT OF THESE TRENDS
../lrs3/train_mini/0akiEFwtkyA/50002 AND HOW WILL THEY TRANSFORM OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURES
../lrs3/train_mini/0Amg53UuRqE/50001 SO CLIMATE CHANGE
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50001 I WAS ASKED A QUESTION BY DEFENSE CANADA
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50002 IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DIAGNOSED EASILY
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50003 WE HAD TWO GROUPS FROM THE MILITARY
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50004 LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50005 THOSE WITH MTBI HAD DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THE VARIOUS TASKS BUT THEY WERE
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50006 SO PHYSICAL TRAUMA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA HAD DISTINCT EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50007 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS NETWORK IT INVOLVES FRONTAL AREAS HIPPOCAMPAL AREAS TEMPORAL LOBE AREAS THAT ARE
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50008 BUT THE SOLDIERS REACTED
../lrs3/train_mini/0Bhk65bYSI0/50009 THEY COULDN'T GET ANY MORE WOUND UP
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50001 IT WAS THE KIND OF OBSESSION THAT HAD HER FAKING INJURIES JUST SO SHE COULD WEAR THEM
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50002 THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THEY'RE DOING
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50003 IF A CHILD WATCHES A TYPICAL AMOUNT OF TELEVISION EVERY YEAR THEY WILL NOW BE SEEING
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50004 SO YOU MIGHT THINK WELL OK SO THE ANSWER'S SIMPLE
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50005 THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE'RE MARKETING TO KIDS LESS WE'RE DOING IT LESS
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50006 PROBABLY ALL OF US KNOW WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THESE DAYS
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50007 73 OF TEENAGERS ARE NOW ON SOME SOCIAL MEDIA SITE
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50008 YOUTUBE FACEBOOK TWITTER
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50009 THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS ON ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50010 THERE ARE NOW DOZENS OF WEBSITES OUT THERE DESIGNED FOR KIDS BY FOOD COMPANIES WITH FREE
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50011 THERE ARE SITES LIKE RONALD
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50012 I'M NOT JUST HERE TO TELL YOU HOW UPSET AS A PARENT I AM
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50013 I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF MAINE THAT WAS THE FIRST TO PASS A
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50014 COM WHICH IS MCDONALD'S SITE JUST FOR PRESCHOOLERS
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50015 I'M SEEING PROOF OF THAT EVERYWHERE I GO
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50016 THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
../lrs3/train_mini/0bop3D7SdDM/50017 IF YOU'RE A TEENAGER TODAY AND YOU'RE WALKING BY A MCDONALD'S YOU MIGHT JUST GET A TEXT MESSAGE PROMOTION FOR A BIG
../lrs3/train_mini/0C5UQbWzwg8/50001 I BOTH LOVE AND HATE THE BUSINESS OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND WHY
../lrs3/train_mini/0C5UQbWzwg8/50002 AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF OF COURSE IS ON THEM NOT ON US
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50001 SO IN 2000 WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION FEE WAS GOING TO MORE THAN
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50002 TWO THINGS HAPPENED AS WE COPED WITH LOSS AND RECOVERY IN NEW YORK CITY
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50003 PEOPLE WHO WERE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY YOUNG PEOPLE I HAD WORKED WITH WERE EXPERIENCING
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50004 YOUNG PEOPLE I HAD WORKED WITH WERE BEING HARASSED NOT JUST BY CLASSMATES BUT ALSO BY THEIR
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50005 AND IT'S THESE THREE THINGS IMMIGRANTS' VOTES VOICES AND VANTAGE POINTS THAT I THINK CAN HELP
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50006 IT WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE TO YOU THAT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN AMERICA ARE WHITE
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50007 AND WHEN PEOPLE LIKE LAN ARE SITTING AT THE POLICY TABLE THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50008 WE HAVE FOUGHT TO BE HERE
../lrs3/train_mini/0d6iSvF1UmA/50009 IT'S NOT JUST MY WORK
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50001 THE THESIS OF THIS TEXT IS ESSENTIALLY THAT
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50002 AND IS IT BAD IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MAKE A COUPLE OF CHANGES
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50003 BECAUSE MEN ARE SCARY PIGS AND PATRIARCHY IS REAL
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50004 PASSING AS A NATURAL WOMAN CAN DECIDE WHETHER I HAVE A GOOD DAY OR A BAD DAY
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50005 MOST OF YOU AGREED WITH ME
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50006 IT SUCKS BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50007 THIRTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE TRANSSEXUAL EMPIRE
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50008 NOT ALL OF YOU HOWEVER
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50009 AND IF I DON'T LOOK RICH BEAUTIFUL AND AMERICAN AM I STILL A WOMAN
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50010 I STOPPED CUTTING MY HAIR
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50011 I WORE DRESSES TO MORNING CLASSES
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50012 MEN WHO JUDGE US TO BE NOT FEMME ENOUGH
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50013 THEY JUST WORK
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50014 THEY JUST ARE
../lrs3/train_mini/0D9QIG36J9Q/50015 THINGS MEN IN THIS COUNTRY AREN'T REALLY ALLOWED TO DO
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50001 WE UNDERSTAND THE HAZARDS OF 1 OF THEM
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50002 HOW DOES NATURE CROSSLINK
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50003 THAT'S WHAT YOU DESCRIBED RIGHT
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50004 COULD COMPANIES ACTUALLY STOP COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER BUT COOPERATE
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50005 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50006 WE'RE DOING THAT NOW WITH OUR DESIGN CHALLENGES
../lrs3/train_mini/0FkuRwU8HFc/50007 SO WHAT CAN YOU DO
../lrs3/train_mini/0FOlwct8k9M/50001 IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY WHEN I WAS STANDING THERE TRUST ME
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50001 I'VE TOLD YOU THESE DISEASES ARE TERRIBLE
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50002 WHERE'S THE HOPE
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50003 AND THAT IN PART REFLECTS THE COMPLEXITY OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50004 AND ONE OF THE BOTTLENECKS IS EARLY IN DRUG DISCOVERY
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50005 ALL THAT SCREENING OCCURS IN ANIMAL MODELS
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50006 THAT'S GREATER THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL GDP
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50007 TAKE A SKIN CELL MAKE IT A MASTER PLURIPOTENT CELL SO YOU COULD THEN MAKE THOSE CELLS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50008 AND THE CHALLENGE HAS LONG BEEN CAN WE HARNESS THE POWER THE UNDOUBTED POWER OF THESE STEM CELLS
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50009 I DON'T THINK MYSELF THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT THOSE STEM CELLS HAVE MADE NEW MYELIN OR NEW NERVES
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50010 SO THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
../lrs3/train_mini/0FQXicAGy5U/50011 I DO BELIEVE THAT THE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE STEM CELLS THAT I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU DO OFFER VERY REAL HOPE
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50001 I THINK IT'S THE PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS AND BOSSES HAVE TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50002 IT WAS BACK IN 1975
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50003 I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS RUNNING TO THE WASHROOM
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50004 I WAS READY TO GIVE UP ON MY DREAM
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50005 BUT A GUEST LECTURER CAME NEAR THE END OF MY UNDERGRAD
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50006 HIS NAME WAS BILL CAMERON
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50007 BILL WAS GIVING A GUEST LECTURE AND AT THE END OF THAT LECTURE HE SAID BY THE WAY I'M WORKING WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50008 HE HAS BROKEN HIS NECK VERY HIGH
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50009 I BLASTED DOWN THERE AFTER THE END OF THAT LECTURE AND INTRODUCED MYSELF
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50010 BILL SAW THIS PASSION IN ME
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50011 THAT I WANTED TO WORK ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50012 HE BECAME ONE OF MY REAL KEY MENTORS
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50013 I WENT BACK
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50015 NOT DISTRACTED BY UNNECESSARY DISCUSSION OR NOISES THAT AREN'T RELATED TO THE JOB
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50016 BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE ISN'T QUITE READY YET
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50017 I'LL THANK YOU
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50018 PEOPLE WITH ONE HAND WILL THANK YOU
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50019 AN EASY TO OPEN DOOR MIGHT ACTUALLY CATCH ON
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50020 HOW DO YOU DO THAT
../lrs3/train_mini/0GL5r3HVAZ0/50021 MOST PRODUCTIVE BAKER I'VE EVER HAD
../lrs3/train_mini/0HEXx3SP8kk/50001 AND IT RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION
../lrs3/train_mini/0HEXx3SP8kk/50002 WHEN I READ THAT I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THOSE NUMBERS
../lrs3/train_mini/0HEXx3SP8kk/50003 I WENT DOWN THERE IN THE WINTER TIME
../lrs3/train_mini/0HYakD8XQ88/50001 THAT NOTHING WOULD EVER BE THE SAME AFTER THAT MOMENT
../lrs3/train_mini/0HYakD8XQ88/50002 COME AT NIGHT
../lrs3/train_mini/0HYakD8XQ88/50003 RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE WITH ME
../lrs3/train_mini/0HYakD8XQ88/50004 AND THAT'S NOT IT FOR ME
../lrs3/train_mini/0hzSUUdTDUA/50001 AND THIS IS THE BIGGEST OXYMORON WE HAVE IN THE SOCIETY
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50001 IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR MOM TO PUT A BLANKET OVER THE BABY
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50002 IT'S NOT THE PAINTING WE WOULD HAVE PAINTED IT'S THE PAINTING THAT WE ACTUALLY PAINTED
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50003 SO SIMILARLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR PARTNER MTTS THEY'VE MADE SOME AMAZING TECHNOLOGIES
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50004 I'M GOING TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM SOME WORK THAT WE DID ON NEWBORN HEALTH
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50005 SO HERE'S A PROBLEM
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50006 THIS IS WHAT WE WANT
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50007 THE PROBLEM IS WITHOUT TECHNICIANS WITHOUT SPARE PARTS DONATIONS LIKE THIS VERY QUICKLY
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50008 SO WE GOT STARTED
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50009 WE PARTNERED WITH A LEADING MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTION HERE IN BOSTON
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50010 WE CONDUCTED MONTHS OF USER RESEARCH OVERSEAS TRYING TO THINK LIKE DESIGNERS HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN LET'S FIGURE
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50011 IT WON LOTS OF AWARDS
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50012 I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FOR US FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO IT'S EITHER TOO SLOW OR IT JUST DOESN'T
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50013 MANUFACTURING FINANCING DISTRIBUTION REGULATION
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50014 MICHAEL FREE AT PATH SAYS YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO WILL CHOOSE USE AND PAY THE DUES FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50015 SIR WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS AND WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50016 WHO IS OUR CUSTOMER
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50017 JAUNDICE AFFECTS TWO THIRDS OF NEWBORNS AROUND THE WORLD
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50018 SO HERE'S AN OVERHEAD WARMER AND A CPAP
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50019 WE TRIED THIS TIME TO GET IT RIGHT
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50020 AND HERE'S WHAT WE DEVELOPED
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50021 LAST STORY HERE
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50022 I'VE GOT A FRIEND IN INDIA WHO TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY TESTED A PIECE OF ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY FOR
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50023 WE DECIDED WE CAN'T PUT A DO NOT ENTER SIGN NEXT TO THE VENT
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50025 SO FIREFLY'S TOTALLY SEALED
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50026 I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE A DEVICE
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50027 ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50028 ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT'S COMING WHETHER WE'RE READY OR NOT
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50029 I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS DESIGNING PRODUCTS
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50030 AND THAT'S DESIGN THAT MATTERS
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50031 THEY WANT BUCK ROGERS THEY DON'T WANT EFFECTIVE
../lrs3/train_mini/0iTehgSOZ8A/50032 IT SOUNDS CRAZY IT SOUNDS DUMB BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY HOSPITALS WHO WOULD RATHER HAVE NO EQUIPMENT THAN SOMETHING THAT LOOKS CHEAP AND
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50001 WE LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50002 SHE SAYS SO I WENT THE NEXT DAY
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50003 I WAS IN LINE FOR REGISTRATION AND I LOOKED AROUND AND JUST KNEW I COULDN'T DO IT I WASN'T READY
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50004 I KNEW I HAD TO QUIT
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50005 WE'VE MADE IT ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50006 LOOK AT THAT
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50007 I KNEW I WAS WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE I KNEW I WAS HOME
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50008 AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO YOU ONCE IN THE FOUR YEARS SINCE THAT DAY
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50009 IF YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T THINK OF ALL THE HANDS THAT DIDN'T GO UP WHEN I ASKED
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50010 YOU'RE JUST ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HASN'T BEEN TOLD
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50011 IT IS THAT WE ARE POWERFUL BEYOND MEASURE
../lrs3/train_mini/0ITHlySbhJE/50012 AND IF YOU CHANGE ONE PERSON'S UNDERSTANDING OF IT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE CARE
../lrs3/train_mini/0JGarsZE1rk/50001 IMAGINE LADY LIBERTY THE BLINDFOLDED WOMAN HOLDING THE SCALE MEANT TO SYMBOLIZE THE BALANCE IN
../lrs3/train_mini/0jmST6bSUoc/50001 USERS CAN REACH SUITABLE BLOOD DONORS WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS DIRECTLY AND SEND THEM
