../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50001 SO HOW CAN WE EVER DO ANYTHING NEW
../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50002 WHAT'S THE POINT
../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50003 THAT'S WHAT SCIENCE OFFERS US
../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50004 AND NOW WE WANT TO SHARE
../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50005 THAT'S THE NEXT STEP
../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50006 SO WE'RE GOING TO WRITE THIS UP AND TRY TO SUBMIT THIS FOR PUBLICATION
../lrs3/val_mini/0g2WE1qXiKM/50007 AND THE DISCUSSION IS WHO CARES
../lrs3/val_mini/0LxPAY9yis8/50001 AND THEY'LL HAVE AROUND THE WALLS SOME SMART BOARDS SO THAT THERE THEY CAN SEE THE PROGRESS THEY MAKE
../lrs3/val_mini/0LxPAY9yis8/50002 SO DESIGNERS NEED TO BE ALL OVER THIS PROCESS
../lrs3/val_mini/0LxPAY9yis8/50003 NOW THIS VEHICLE IS AN OBJECT LESSON IN BEING THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
../lrs3/val_mini/0LxPAY9yis8/50004 I GET INTO THE AIRCRAFT JOIN MY FELLOW PASSENGERS
../lrs3/val_mini/0NV1KdWRHck/50004 IT ENDS WHERE IT BEGINS FROM TO COMPLETE ITSELF
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50001 WHEN I TOOK THIS STAGE YOU ALL ASSUMED THAT I'M SOME CHILD GENIUS OR SOME ACCREDITED
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50002 I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WORTHY OF YOUR ATTENTION
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50003 BECAUSE I'M 17 AND I'M ON THIS STAGE YOU'RE ONLY RESPECTING ME BECAUSE I'M ON THIS STAGE
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50004 I'VE BEEN TOLD BY ADULTS THAT I'M NOT READY TO VOTE EVEN THOUGH I KEEP UP WITH POLITICS AND I'M SURE OF MY BELIEFS
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50005 WHAT CAN I TEACH YOU ABOUT
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50006 BUT BY THIS TIME I HOPE I'VE GAINED YOUR RESPECT
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50007 I SAY GAINED BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER SPEAKERS I DIDN'T HAVE IT INITIALLY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50008 I'D TRY TALKING TO AN ADULT ABOUT SOMETHING I'D BE WORKING ON MY RESEARCH OR A PROJECT AND
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50009 HOW COULD YOU KNOW THIS
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50010 FROM MY CONTRASTING EXPERIENCES AT ONE STONE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE AMAZING TEACHERS I'VE HAD I'VE BECOME FULLY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50011 YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THE CONTROL OVER WHAT YOU LEARN
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50012 SOMETIMES I CATCH MYSELF ON A WILD TRAIN OF THOUGHT AND STOP MYSELF THINKING
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50013 YOU'RE ONLY 17 YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50015 DO WE WAKE UP ON OUR 21ST BIRTHDAYS WITH EVERLASTING KNOWLEDGE
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50016 IT HASN'T SEEMED TO WORK SO FAR SO WHO'S RIGHT
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50017 THE ADULTS BEHIND THEM HAVE CONDITIONED ATTEMPTS AT SOLVING THEM WHICH IS WHY WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50018 MAYBE THIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS CREATIVELY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50019 THIS IS MY IDEA WORTH SPREADING
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50020 IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE TEACHING THEM TO STOP THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND TO ACCEPT ADEQUACY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50021 SO THAT'S NOT LOGICAL EITHER
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50022 ASK US ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY ASK US ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION ASK
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50023 IT'S TRUE THAT NOT ALL OF US WILL UNDERSTAND THESE POLICIES RIGHT AWAY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50024 JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TEENAGERS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICS AND SIMILARLY JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADULT DOESN'T
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50025 I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH AGE OR EXPERIENTIAL MATURITY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50026 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF IT'S A COLLABORATION
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50027 ADULTS I'M ASKING YOU TO WORK WITH US
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50028 GIVE US YOUR RESPECT HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50029 I'M NOT ASKING FOR BLIND FAITH I'M ASKING FOR YOU TO LET US PROVE IT
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50030 I CAN HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TOO
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50031 WE NEED TO HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY PROGRESS TO BE MADE AND I PROMISE YOU IT WILL
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50032 I HAVEN'T WON A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE I HAVEN'T SOLVED INEQUALITY I HAVEN'T SOLVED POVERTY
../lrs3/val_mini/0OkOQhXhsIE/50033 IT'S NO SECRET THAT SOCIETY HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE JUST CAN'T QUITE SEEM TO SOLVE
../lrs3/val_mini/0P0mBj09vwk/50001 I DON'T KNOW
../lrs3/val_mini/0P0mBj09vwk/50002 IS THAT EVEN ETHICAL
../lrs3/val_mini/0P0mBj09vwk/50003 AND THAT WAS A RED FLAG FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF SPECIALTY AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN
../lrs3/val_mini/0P0mBj09vwk/50004 IT'S NOT VERY HEAVY I CAN DO IT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM BUT NONETHELESS I LIKE TO HOLD ONTO IT
../lrs3/val_mini/0P0mBj09vwk/50005 IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG
../lrs3/val_mini/0tqq66zwa7g/50001 WE DECIDED TO SEE IF WE COULD CHANGE THEIR MINDSET
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50001 MY MOTHER HAD A FIT
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50002 THEY GET THOSE THINGS MIXED UP
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50003 THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50004 EVEN THOUGH I HAD MET P
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50005 I'M LIKE I HEAR YOU BROTHER I HEAR YOU
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50006 I'M A MAINE BOY I'M A MAINE BOY AND IT WAS WEIRD TO MOVE TO LA
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50007 IT WAS WEIRD BECAUSE YOU KNOW LA IS THE PLASTIC SURGERY CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50008 IT'S THE SAME MOTIVATION
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50009 WE JUST LABEL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50010 IT'S OK IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU
../lrs3/val_mini/0YeVt2kpSSo/50011 I WANT YOU TO STAY THERE
../lrs3/val_mini/1BHOflzxPjI/50001 UNPAID CARE ECONOMY
../lrs3/val_mini/1BHOflzxPjI/50002 AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE FACE GETTING EVERYBODY OUT OF POVERTY AND COMING BACK WITHIN WHAT
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50001 YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF WALL THERE YOU'VE SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WANT TO GET ACROSS AND IT'S THE
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50002 I'VE GOT THESE INNOVATIONS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND I CAN ALSO SEE THAT SOME OF THESE WE'VE SEEN BEFORE IN FACT ONE OF
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50003 I GET TO TEACH UNIVERSITY PHYSICS CLASSES I GET TO RUN SCIENCE PROGRAMMES FOR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50004 WE NEED TO START THE SPACE RACE AND PROTECT OURSELVES FROM SOME NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50005 I SEE ALL OF THESE INNOVATIONS THAT I'M TOLD OR OFFERED AS THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO INNOVATE WHAT YOU'RE
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50006 SO I TURNED TO A SCRAPBOOK I HAVE I COLLECT PICTURES OR I TAKE PICTURES IN THE SCRAPBOOK
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50007 SO THAT'S KIND OF MY QUEST THAT IS MY DREAM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PATH I WANT TO TAKE YOU ALONG WITH ON THIS PARTICULAR TALK
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50008 THE FIRST IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVERHEAD PROJECTORS AND WE TALK ABOUT MOOCS AND WE TALK ABOUT OPEN EDUCATIONAL
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50009 BUT OF COURSE LEARNING IS A LOT MORE THAN THAT
../lrs3/val_mini/1cJiAS6NSUI/50010 WE CAN'T WAIT FOR AN INNOVATION TO COME DOWN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND BE BESTOWED UPON US TO SAVE OUR
../lrs3/val_mini/1gdKrtwBGqY/50001 SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE BRIDGE THIS GULF
../lrs3/val_mini/1hxwsYYz5fI/50001 IT'S LIKE OK IT WAS CUTE IN THE BEGINNING BUT NOW IT'S NOT
../lrs3/val_mini/1hxwsYYz5fI/50002 IT CAN BE HAPPY
../lrs3/val_mini/1hxwsYYz5fI/50003 A CYCLE OF ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO BE HAPPY TO SPREAD THAT HAPPINESS BECAUSE ONE PERSON IS ALL THAT
../lrs3/val_mini/1isiSaTSXb8/50001 I MUST ADMIT WHEN I FIRST WENT TO MY CEREMONY I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO EXPECT
../lrs3/val_mini/1isiSaTSXb8/50002 BUT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOVING
../lrs3/val_mini/1SS2wOnkcSk/50001 WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE EXTREMISTS GUIDED BY THEIR MORAL
../lrs3/val_mini/1SS2wOnkcSk/50002 SO TAKING THIS IDEA FURTHER MY COLLEAGUES ALSO LOOKED AT WHETHER SEROTONIN LEVELS INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT WE RESPOND
../lrs3/val_mini/1SS2wOnkcSk/50003 THOSE WHO READ THE ARTICLE ABOUT CHANGEABLE GROUPS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE WILLING TO MEET WITH THE OTHER SIDE
../lrs3/val_mini/1SS2wOnkcSk/50004 BUT I DO THINK IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT ONE DAY WE WILL HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT BRAIN
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50001 NOW I DON'T THINK OLD TOM BRADY USES THE SAME KIND OF TOOL I USE WHICH ARE NUMBERS
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50002 IF YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND REALLY THE SOURCES AND DRIVERS OF PROFITABILITY
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50003 SHE SAID OKAY YOU'VE LEFT MICROSOFT
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50004 SHE'D BEEN VERY BUSY WITH OUR PHILANTHROPIC STUFF OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AND SHE SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50005 AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW I'M JUST KIND OF KICKING BACK BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50006 BESIDES THE GOVERNMENT'S THE BEST PHILANTHROPY IT'S THE BIGGEST PHILANTHROPY IN THE WORLD
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50007 I WAS HOPING I COULD FIND SOMETHING LIKE A 10 K DOCUMENT THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50008 WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50009 I ASK PEOPLE
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50010 MAYBE EVEN IN THE WORST CASE IN SCHOOL NUMBERS WERE SOMETHING THAT YOU MEMORIZED FOR SOME PURPOSE SOME
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50011 WHO BUILT THE ROAD IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50012 INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENDITURE IS MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE ACTUALLY WITH PRETTY
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50013 TO TRY TO TRY OUT SOME OF THE IDEAS
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50014 FEDERAL INCOME TAX
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50015 WE'RE A LITTLE BAND BUT WE GET A LOT OF HELP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50016 THAT'S A QUESTION BY THE NUMBERS YOU CAN ANSWER THAT IS AN OUTCOME
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50017 WE DON'T WANT THIS PRIVATE SHADOW SOMEBODY WILL WORRY ABOUT THE SOURCE BEING A D OR AN R OR A BLAH
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50018 AND THAT'S JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50019 I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I STARTED THIS
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50020 THERE'S OVER 90000 INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT JURISDICTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50021 WHAT ABOUT PHILANTHROPY AND CIVIC ACTIVISM AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING A BASKETBALL TEAM AND PAYING TAXES
../lrs3/val_mini/1VRgmKiE0Js/50022 THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
../lrs3/val_mini/2a2724wcfcc/50001 BACK IN 2006 I DECIDED TO HAVE SOME FUN ONE DAY AND AS AN EXPERIMENT I RECORDED MYSELF PLAYING A
../lrs3/val_mini/2a2724wcfcc/50002 MORE PEOPLE THAN HAD EVER SEEN ME PLAY IN ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE COMBINED
../lrs3/val_mini/2a2724wcfcc/50003 HOW COULD I MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME NOT JUST LISTENING BUT ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTING
../lrs3/val_mini/2a2724wcfcc/50004 BY UTILIZING STREAMING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIVITY I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SPACE
../lrs3/val_mini/2AZwSkHTkCU/50001 TELL ME WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR
../lrs3/val_mini/2AZwSkHTkCU/50002 WE HAVE NOW HELD PEACE MASK PROJECT WORKSHOPS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING
../lrs3/val_mini/2AZwSkHTkCU/50003 WE WITNESSED KILOMETER AFTER KILOMETER OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES FLATTENED ALONG THE
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50001 FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE PREPAID PHONES ARE RECHARGED AT LESS THAN 20 CENTS
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50002 BUT TODAY DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A BOTTOM UP PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY HAS REALIZED THE BENEFITS OF
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50003 AND THEREFORE DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME EMBEDDED
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50004 BUT TODAY FINALLY AFTER ECONOMIC REFORMS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH I THINK THE NOTION THAT CITIES
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50005 EVERY PROVINCE HAD ITS OWN MARKET FOR AGRICULTURE
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50006 A LOT OF THE INDIAN PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO THE IDEOLOGY OF CASTE AND OTHER THINGS
../lrs3/val_mini/2cYDyMnL4M8/50007 THIS POLICY IS CAUSING GRIDLOCK
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50001 ECONOMISTS CALL THESE EFFECTS COMPLEMENTARITIES BUT REALLY THAT'S JUST A FANCY WORD TO CAPTURE THE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50002 RESOLVING THIS TERMINATOR MYTH SHOWS US THAT THERE ARE TWO FORCES AT PLAY ONE MACHINE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50004 THERE'S COUNTLESS SYSTEMS OUT THERE THAT CAN DIAGNOSE MEDICAL PROBLEMS
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50005 THEY'VE FALLEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE MYTH THE BELIEF THAT MACHINES HAVE TO COPY THE WAY THAT HUMAN
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50006 THINK HOW OFTEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY TO YOU MACHINES CAN ONLY PERFORM TASKS THAT ARE PREDICTABLE OR REPETITIVE RULES
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50007 AND THESE THINGS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ARTICULATE AND SO IT WAS THOUGHT THESE TASKS WOULD BE VERY HARD TO AUTOMATE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50008 TO SEE THIS GO BACK TO THE CASE OF MAKING A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50009 EARLIER IN THE YEAR A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD ANNOUNCED THEY'D DEVELOPED A SYSTEM WHICH CAN TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT A
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50010 HOW DOES IT WORK
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50011 IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT THAT HUMAN BEING THAT DOCTOR COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW SHE'D PERFORMED THE TASK
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50012 A PICTURE THAT WE SEE ON OUR TELEVISION SCREENS IN BOOKS IN FILMS IN EVERYDAY COMMENTARY IS ONE WHERE AN ARMY
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50013 THE LUMP OF WORK WASN'T FIXED
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50014 AS THIS WORKER USED THE MACHINE AND BECAME MORE PRODUCTIVE THE PRICE OF WASHERS WOULD FALL DEMAND FOR WASHERS WOULD RISE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50015 AND TODAY YOU HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LUMP OF LABOR FALLACY TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ALL TYPES OF WORK
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50016 THERE'S NO FIXED LUMP OF WORK OUT THERE TO BE DIVIDED UP BETWEEN PEOPLE AND MACHINES
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50017 NEW TASKS HAVE TO BE DONE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50020 TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS RATHER THAN COMPLEMENT HUMAN BEINGS COMPLEMENTS MACHINES INSTEAD
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50021 HUMAN BEINGS ONLY STAND TO BENEFIT IF THEY RETAIN THE UPPER HAND IN ALL THESE COMPLEMENTED TASKS BUT
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50022 SO WHAT DO THESE THREE MYTHS TELL US THEN
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50023 THIS IS THE PATH WE'RE CURRENTLY ON
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50024 ALMOST EVERYONE LIVED ON OR AROUND THE POVERTY LINE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50025 THOSE ECONOMIC PIES HAVE EXPLODED IN SIZE
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50026 IF ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES AT TWO PERCENT OUR CHILDREN WILL BE TWICE AS RICH AS US
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50027 AS OTHER ECONOMISTS HAVE NOTED SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WON'T BE EASY
../lrs3/val_mini/2j00U6lUCSc/50028 THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION FOR INSTANCE ABOUT VARIOUS FORMS OF UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AS ONE
../lrs3/val_mini/2Kk9R2rhwlQ/50001 MANY SELFIES MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF EXPERTISE OR NOT HAVE A BLUR WITHIN THE IMAGE ITSELF
../lrs3/val_mini/2KSP7HvSZwg/50001 A BIT DANGEROUS SOMETIMES
../lrs3/val_mini/2KSP7HvSZwg/50002 PERHAPS AFRICA CAN AVOID SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE
../lrs3/val_mini/2KSP7HvSZwg/50003 YOU CAN GO AND BUY SOME OF THE GREAT TUNES
../lrs3/val_mini/2KSP7HvSZwg/50004 MY IPOD'S FULL OF THEM
../lrs3/val_mini/2KSP7HvSZwg/50005 YOU SEE THE MIDDLE CLASS GROW
